# Hangman Game
My first personal project - Creating an executable Hangman game using python and tk interface. Bundling with PyInstaller.

## Challenges
- Issue with file pathing after PyInstaller bundling
- Learning to use TK Interface
- Making the interface interactive and responsive

## Time taken
The project took roughly 24 hours including learning of relevant python libraries, algorithm design, coding and debugging
